# Vintage Marketplace

Vintage is a marketplace simulator system that allows users to simulate buying and selling fashion products. This system, written in Java, performs a realistic experience for buying and selling products in a fictional marketplace, where users can sell both new and used items.

## Getting Started

To use this simulator, you will need to have Java installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Java [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/).

To install the simulator, you can either download the source code from this repository or clone the repository using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/JoseMatos03/vintage-sim.git
```

## Usage


## Features

The simulator allows you to create users, list items, and even create or edit carriers. Every change you make is automatically saved and loaded every time you launch the simulator.

You can also check all user details, carrier details, and item details, as well as check how much money "Vintage" has made since launch.

The simulator also includes a "fast forward" mechanism that simulates the passage of time without having to wait for real-time to pass.
